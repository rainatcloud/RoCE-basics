除了老的ibv编程接口之外，The user space RDMA subsystem (known as RDMA-core) library introduces two new libmlx5 API
channels named mlx5_dv_* and mlx5dv_devx_*:
• mlx5dv is a channel to configure hardware objects with Mellanox specific attributes.
• mlx5dv_devx is a channel that exposes raw Mellanox hardware objects, enabling the use of
hardware features with minimal kernel changes (some of the mlx5dv APIs use mlx5dv_devx
in user space level).
